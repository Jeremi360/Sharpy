# <Language name>

My own programming langue.
Inspired by Python, CSharp and GDScript
plus my own ideas that I didn't saw in any langue.

## Language Concepts

- divide, mix and match your code:
	keywords `use`, `as` and `hide` can be used
	to differentiate between values and functions with
	that same name, but form different script
- every thing is public by default
- every thing is overrideable by default
- expandable enums at runtime
- `static` like in **C#** 
- `if` is `if` and also a `match` from **GDScript**
- `get set` like in **GDScript**
	so you don't need extra variable to store value
- only easy to understand sugar code, **no** lambdas
- `skip` instead of confusing `continue` in `for` loop
- `wait` instead of confusing `yield`
- signals like in **GDScript**
- option to add extra functions and operators by external scripts like in  **C#**
- commas (`,`) are optional
- blocks of code starts with `:` and continues by indent like in **Python / GDScript**
